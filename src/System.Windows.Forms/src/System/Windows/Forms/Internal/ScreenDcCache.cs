    /// <remarks>
    ///  This caching counts on consumers not leaving the HDC in a dirty state. There is a signficant overhead to
    ///  saving and restoring the state which would make this cache much less impactful. If we can't have confidence
    ///  the DC state is being restored the best option may be to simply create a brand new screen DC every time we
    ///  need one. That said, these DCs are safe to use across threads, as the creating thread is left running.
    ///
    ///  Creating a screen DC from scratch and deleting it takes about 11us. Saving and restoring takes about half
    ///  that time. Jumping to the other thread to get a safe DC when we've run out of cached items is roughly a 10us
    ///  extra cost. Renting an existing DC from the cache and returning it is on the order of 20_ns_. If we were
    ///  forced to save state we'd be taking about 9us renting and returning cached DCs- which would take around
    ///  20 rentals to break even with simply creating and tossing away a brand new DC.
